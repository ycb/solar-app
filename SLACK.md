Hi team,

A few clarifying questions:

1) Workflow: Should I think of the installer documentation experience as a single task prior to inspection, or as a series of capture moments that guide installers to ensure code compliance?

2) MVP capture surface: For v1, what evidence types should I assume are in scope?

• Images only, or images + video?
• Any non-image inputs (text, serial numbers, voice notes, document scans)?
• Can you describe criteria that makes imagery “acceptable” vs “insufficient”?
• Is there a short list of inspection items we consider “must-capture” for v1?

3) System context: Should I treat this as a standalone installer tool, or as an extension of SolarAPP+? If possible, could you share access to SolarAPP+ or screenshots of the most relevant user flows?

Hi @Peter Spannagle! Sorry it took me a bit to get to this. Answers:

You could go either way. I would likely think of it as a series of capture moments during the installer process; how guided it is will be totally up to you. Great questions re: MVP. I would assume images + video. Non-image inputs would likely come from the existing documentation present in plans or in SolarAPP+ outputs; we may already have the list of equipment they say they will install and this may consist of verifying it. Let's keep this out of scope for now.I would say that it has to be clear, any letters and numbers have to be readable, and the framign / quality has to be 'good enough' to distinguish key information, such as quality of worksmanshipLet's say we need to verify the equipment is the same equipment they said they'd install; it's connected to the same electrical components they stated, fire access pathways are at least 3 feet, where required, and the worksmanship quality is acceptable. Also, need to view the main service panel. Treat as a standalone tool! But - I can definitely get a short video if you'd still prefer this, just @ me and i willDan Lopez  [1:50 PM]
