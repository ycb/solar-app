Head of Product (VI): Vibe Coding Assessment
SolarAPP+
Purpose of this Exercise
This assessment is designed to understand how you think and lead as a Head of Product.
We’re interested in how you frame ambiguous problems, your use of tools (including AI) to
accelerate thinking, your approach to balancing guidance vs. simplicity for real users, where you
make tradeoffs and reason about outcomes, and how you collaborate and ask questions when
information is incomplete.
This is not a test of solar permitting knowledge or pixel-perfect designs. We care more about
how you think and execute rather than the perfection of the exact solution you propose. You
have one week to complete this exercise, it should take you no longer than 4 hours to complete,
and submission guidelines are at the end of the document.

The Challenge
You’re developing the first version of a mobile app that helps solar installers document their
completed installation for inspection purposes. In this specific case, the installers you’re working
with are installing residential rooftop solar and a battery storage system on single-family homes,
where they are working onsite, often time-constrained, and working alone or with a small crew.
The goal of the app is to help installers capture the right information the first time, reduce
back-and-forth with inspectors, increase confidence that an installation is inspection-ready, and
do this without requiring installers to be solar code experts.
Your Task
Design and prototype a mobile experience that helps an installer document a completed
installation for inspection.
Some helpful contextual questions to consider:
● How do you guide installers through what needs to be captured?
● How do you avoid overwhelming them with code language or regulatory detail?
● How are photos captured, organized, and reviewed?
● How does the installer know what to photograph and from what angle?
● What signals completeness, readiness, or confidence?

Using AI (Encouraged)
We recognize AI is widely used in product and tech roles, and we encourage you to use AI as a
force multiplier, to help you think and explore your solutions to this challenge.
Please include:
● 1-2 specific prompts you used for this assessment (screenshots of the prompts and your
answers, please)
● A brief note on how AI influenced (or didn’t influence) your thinking
Slack Collaboration
During the assessment window, you’ll have access to a private Slack channel where you can
ask clarifying questions, pressure-test assumptions, and get lightweight context directly from the
team. This will give you and our team a real-world opportunity to collaborate and support you as
you problem solve.

Submission Guidelines:
● Effort limit: ~4 hours total
● Delivery window: 1 week, due date listed in email
● Tools: Your choice
● AI: Encouraged as a thought partner, product designer, etc.
● Collaboration: You’ll have access to a private Slack channel with our team for questions
and dialogue during the week, invite will be sent directly to your email
● Submission: Please upload to the SolarApp+ Slack Channel and send an email to Jen
Tress (jen@vergetalentpartners.com) confirming it’s been uploaded.
Please include the following in your upload:
○ An interactive prototype that is mobile-first, showing 3-5 key screens that
represent the core experience of the end user. The level of fidelity is up to you.
○ Share a voice recording OR video (3-5 minutes long) that answers the following
questions:
■ What did you assume about installers, inspections, or constraints? What
did you intentionally not assume?
■ What did you prioritize? What did you leave out, and why?
■ How would you test this with real installers?
■ If this were v1, what would you build next?
■ What would unlock the most learning or value for you to continue building
this out?

○ Screenshots of the AI prompts and answers you used as part of this assessment

Note about our Evaluation Criteria
We care about how you think, how you explain your decisions, and how you balance speed,
clarity, and real-world constraints in a regulated product environment. We are not looking for
perfection, but want to deeply understand your approach to problem solving, product
development, and your ability to drive a process forward within an ambiguous environment.
We appreciate the time and care this takes and sincerely thank you for your interest in working
with SolarApp+. We look forward to seeing your completed assessment!
