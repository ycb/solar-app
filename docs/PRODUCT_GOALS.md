What the installer must visually verify (v1 scope)

These are the inspection-critical checks your app supports.
	1.	PV array installed as permitted
	•	Location matches plans
	•	Array visible with proper setbacks
	2.	Inverter identity + access
	•	Inverter matches permitted type
	•	Nameplate legible
	•	Clearances visible
	3.	Battery / ESS installation
	•	Battery in final location
	•	Clearances to walls/ceiling
	•	Nameplate legible
	4.	Electrical connections + disconnects
	•	PV and ESS disconnects present
	•	Conduit routing visible
	•	Components connected as expected
	5.	Fire access pathways
	•	≥3 ft clearance where required
	•	Pathways visible in context shots
	6.	Labels / placards
	•	Rapid shutdown labels
	•	ESS warning labels
	•	Main service placards visible
	7.	Main service panel
	•	Panel exterior
	•	Panel interior with breaker labeling
	•	Required placards visible

Note: Main service panel capture is a single photo in v1.

How this appears in the installer app (example)

Instead of showing brands/models, the UI prompts:
	•	“Verify installed inverter matches permitted inverter”
	•	“Capture battery installed in final location with clearances”
	•	“Show PV and ESS disconnects”
	•	“Capture main service panel and labeling”

Internally, each prompt maps to:
	•	Expected component category
	•	Required visual evidence
	•	Completeness + clarity checks
