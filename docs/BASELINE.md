Recommended v1 capture set 

If you want to keep the prototype disciplined while meeting scope, capture these 7 groups:
	1.	Array context + attachment
	2.	Inverter identity + clearance
	3.	Battery location + clearance
	4.	Disconnects (PV + ESS)
	5.	Fire access pathways
	6.	Labels / placards
	7.	Main service panel

This set covers the required verification areas and includes a single required video.

Below is a generalized California baseline “required evidence checklist” for a residential rooftop solar + battery (ESS) final inspection, abstracted across AHJs. This is not code text and not jurisdiction-specific—it’s the common denominator most inspectors implicitly expect to verify.

This is the right level to use for your v1 assumptions and to justify a representative subset in the exercise.

Mental model inspectors use

Inspectors are answering four questions:
	1.	Is this the system that was permitted?
	2.	Is it installed safely and accessibly?
	3.	Is required labeling present and readable?
	4.	Can I defend approving this later?

Your checklist should map to those questions.

Generalized CA baseline — final inspection evidence

A. Site + system context

Purpose: verify location and scope
	•	Building exterior showing array location
	•	Main service panel / meter location
	•	Overall view tying equipment together (context shot)

⸻

B. PV array (roof)

Purpose: structural + electrical safety
	•	Array from ground (show placement and setbacks)
	•	Close-up of roof penetration / flashing
	•	Module attachment / racking detail
	•	Grounding / bonding method (if visible)
	•	Conduit routing from array (as applicable)

Common failure: missing context or unclear attachment detail.

⸻

C. Inverter(s)

Purpose: correct equipment + access
	•	Inverter installed in final location
	•	Nameplate clearly readable
	•	Working clearances visible
	•	AC/DC disconnect proximity

Common failure: unreadable nameplate, unclear clearance.

⸻

D. Rapid shutdown (PV)

Purpose: firefighter safety
	•	Rapid shutdown device location
	•	Labeling at inverter and service equipment
	•	Demonstration of accessibility (not functionality)

⸻

E. Battery / ESS

Purpose: fire + electrical safety
	•	Battery installed in final location
	•	Clearances to walls/ceilings
	•	Nameplate readable
	•	Mounting method (wall/floor)
	•	Conduit and disconnects serving ESS

Common failure: clearance ambiguity, missing label.

⸻

F. Electrical disconnects

Purpose: emergency shutoff
	•	PV AC disconnect
	•	ESS disconnect
	•	Clear labeling (“PV AC Disconnect,” “ESS Disconnect”)
	•	Relationship to main service panel

⸻

G. Main service panel

Purpose: system integration
	•	Panel interior (breaker labeling)
	•	Backfed breaker / OCPD
	•	Placards indicating PV + ESS presence
	•	Directory updated

⸻

H. Required placards & labels

Purpose: compliance + safety
	•	Main service placards
	•	Rapid shutdown labels
	•	ESS warning labels
	•	Placard visibility and legibility

This is one of the highest rejection drivers.

⸻

I. Equipment identity confirmation

Purpose: match permit
	•	Serial numbers (inverter + battery)
	•	Model numbers if different SKUs exist

This can be photo or structured text.

⸻

What is usually not required for final inspection

(important for scope discipline)
	•	Permit documents rescanned
	•	Engineering calcs
	•	Manufacturer datasheets
	•	Install-in-progress photos
	•	Inspector-style narrative notes

Those belong upstream.

⸻

How inspectors judge “acceptable” imagery (informal rules)

Photos are acceptable if they:
	•	Are well-lit
	•	Show context + detail
	•	Have legible nameplates/labels
	•	Are clearly tied to a specific checklist item

Photos are insufficient if they:
	•	Are zoomed too far in (no context)
	•	Are too far away (no detail)
	•	Cut off labels or clearances
	•	Leave inspectors guessing orientation or location

This is where AI-assisted feedback shines.
