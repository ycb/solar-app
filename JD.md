Head of Product - Virtual Inspections
SolarAPP Foundation | Location: Remote (within the State of CA)
About Us
SolarAPP is cutting the costs of the clean energy transition, making it so that everyone can afford to power their lives with clean energy. Our automated plan review and permitting software reduces soft costs by turning a weeks-long bureaucratic process into instant approval. We're already deployed in over 500 cities across 17 states, with more than 120,000 permits issued, representing over 800,000 kW of clean energy. We're growing fast to expand our impact, developing capabilities to conduct virtual inspections once permitted projects are complete. This will allow us to serve governments and contractors with an end-to-end solution for streamlining residential projects. Join a team building tools that enable safe, automated, and instantaneous permitting and inspections for solar, storage, EV charging, and other clean energy technologies.
About the Role
We're seeking a Head of Product to own the full 0-1 lifecycle of SolarAPP's Virtual Inspection product line from the ground up, and you'll have something most early-stage product leaders dream of: a proven distribution model, an established user base, and immediate access to a massive market. This is a rare opportunity to join a founding team increasing access to affordable solar energy for individuals, families, and businesses across the country.
You'll work across engineering, product, contractors, inspectors, regulators, and funders to build a tool that meets national standards while staying practical and intuitive for users in the field. One day you'll be analyzing building codes, the next you'll be writing tickets with engineers or testing prototypes with inspectors on actual job sites.
If you're excited about owning an entire multi-platform digital product from inception to launch and beyond, thrive in a "we'll figure it out" environment, and are passionate about accelerating clean energy adoption, this is the role for you.
Reports to: Chief Technology Officer (CTO)
Who you'll work closely with: cross-functional delivery, tech, and operations team members
What You'll Do
This role centers on owning the full lifecycle of SolarAPP's Virtual Inspection product, including research and strategy through prototyping, pilots, and launch. You'll translate complex regulatory and field requirements into a clear product roadmap, drive cross-functional alignment, and deliver a tool that meets jurisdictional standards while accelerating clean-energy adoption. This role will also require some in-state travel within California to strengthen relationships with end users, conduct research, and complete product testing.

Intro


I’m a product leader with 15 years of experience in growth and emerging technologies. My background includes front-end engineering, UX, and 8 years managing full-lifecycle execution.

I’ve led 0–1 at early-stage startups and delivered impact at scale for global brands. My strengths are navigating ambiguity, distilling complex workflows, and creating systems that drive adoption and scale.
For the past 6 years, I’ve built software that bridges physical and digital systems for energy and infrastructure. At Aurora I scaled solar design and sales tools. At Enact I built products for post-sale monetization of PV and storage systems. I also founded a startup that developed 3D training simulations for plumbers and electricians. 
I have 4 years experience building AI/ML solutions, including explainable ML for internal tools at Meta and NLP chatbot design at Samsung. I spent the last 6 months building AI tools for PMs to deepen my familiarity with tools and workflows for GenAI software development.
I have 6+ years of experience leading high-performing product teams. I build systems that increase collaboration, accountability, and alignment to company goals. My leadership philosophy centers on empathy, candor, and psychological safety. 
In my next role, I’m looking to join an early-stage clean energy company where I can work end-to-end 
across strategy, execution, and go-to-market.
